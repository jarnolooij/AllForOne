# AllForOne Assignment --- Mechanic Fever

## 2020 Corona special compromise
This year, due to changes in schedulling, program and the online learning environment, there is an overload of assignments. Therefore here is a compromise option.

You can develop half of the requirements of the game and you will be fully graded on that half of the game. 
Keep in mind that now the assignment is cut in half, you need to follow the requirements as close as possible. **Read this file very carefully for your half and follow the requirements.**
The two halves are divided as follows:

### Half 1 - The unit creation:
From the beginning of the game (top view map of the level), unit stats and player points management, Unit placement on the map. Everything until just before the first action turn. 
Once all Units are bought and placed on the map by the players (in turns), the game goes into a screen that says: "Action gameplay comming soon... or not... Stay tuned... or not."

### Half 2 - The action mechanics:
This half starts already with 5 units placed on the map for each player, all with middle stats (50%). The rest of the game should all be there. Unit picking, 3rd person mechanics, unit health management, power up management and 

### Which part to choose?
This is up to you, here are some facts to help you:

* Half 1 is less work, less features, but it is much more "custom". There is less code you can grab from other sources and you have a lot of decisions to make in terms of architecture. In this half you can really squeeze those "Code / architecture quality" points. It is also heavier on UI.
* Half 2 is bigger and more features to test and polish. It includes more parts of the game and it is more prone for bugs and time consuming fixes. But in exchange it is all based on very common and readily available that should be standard or re-used from past projects. These, like movement, attack, camera movements, stat management should not take you a considerable ammount of time, they should be standard and done as quickly as possible, re-using any code you can from other projects, standard assets, google, etc...
You should focus on how the mechanics interact with each other to create a compelling and complete game.

### Both include:
* Level design for the corridor system.
* Turn management (for unit buying/placing on Half 1, for action gameplay on Half 2).

(Deadline has been updated on the bottom of this file)

## DESCRIPTION
On this assignment everyone makes the same game **"Mechanic Fever"**. How you make it is what matters...
The assignment is focused on code elegance and production value. You do not need to add all the mechanics described, but prioritize carfully so that you end up with a game that makes sense and is playable.

## GENERAL MECHANICS

You will build a 3D turn-based digital "board game" in which every turn is played as a third person action game.
The game is to be played by 2 players. They can be both on the same computer (Chair shuffle) or if you feel super confident you can make it networked (optional). It is recomended to go for chair shuffle first and THEN adapt to networked.

* The game starts with a top view map of a corridor system.
* Every player has an initial point budget of 100 points to buy and place units anywhere on the map. They do this in turn. meaning that player 1 "buys" and places 1 unit in the game area, then player 2 places one unit, then player 1 again, until both either run out of points or press a "Done" button.
* Units are humanoid 3D characters. They have a set of stats that amount to:
  - Health
  - Strength
  - Speed
  - Defense
* Each player will have a color - Player1 is RED, player 2 is BLUE. All units of each player must have an element of that color. That could be clothing, skin, a light or a overhead floating object, aura etc. Up to you.
* When buying a unit the price depends on the balance of the stats, and that will also influence how many units each player is going to have. So stratigically one player could choose to set up a single unit with full stats and play with only one "super soldier" or have 10 weak units.
* When all units are placed, the game starts.
* On the begining of each turn, one power up or weapon will randomly spawn on the play area.
* The current player will then choose one unit to control by clicking it.
* Once the player clicks the unit the camera flies into 3rd person mode, a 10 second timer starts and the player now has full control of the character and can (more details on each of these below):
  - Run
  - Jump
  - Attack / use weapon (if you have one)
  - Pick up power ups and weapons
  - Use power ups
  - Fortify
* Once the 10 seconds are finished the turn is over.
* The game ends when one of the players has no more units alive. Obviously the other player wins.

## LEVEL DESIGN
The play area will be partly indoor, partly outdoor, there will be one or more single floor buildings made out of winding corridors with doors and windows and Props inside and outside. There will be multiple doors that lead to the outdoor part of the level so that players can use them as shortcuts. 

## PRE-GAME MECHANICS
This is the initial phase where the players buy and place units on the game area. The flow is as follows:
* Player gets a Unit character that is displayed on the screen with randomized body (this can be a different scene or a overlay).
* The stats of the unit are shown and the current price of the unit as well. These are randomly assigned by default but around the mid-range.
* The player can choose any value for each stats. That will cause the price to be recalculated (see balancing).
* When the player is ready to buy then he should hit the "Hire" button. This takes the game to the top view of the game area and the player will then click a location where the Unit should spawn.

### Balancing
* A unit with full stats (100% on all stats), will cost 100 points 
* A unit with the minimum skill (1% on all stats) should cost about 10 points.
* Each skill has different cost, they are distributed in this order:
  - Health and Speed (Same price / Most expensive)
  - Strength and Defense (Same price / Slightly cheaper)

## BOARD MECHANICS DETAIL

* The full game area should be visible on the top view.
* First thing that happens when a turn starts is that a power up spawns randomly on the scene. This should be clearly visible.
* There should be a clear element that tells which player's turn it is.
* The color of the units should also be clearly visible.

## ACTION MECHANICS DETAIL

* When the player starts, the counter should be clearly visible and counting down from 10.
* The player can:
  - Run / Jump anywhere on the game area
  - Attack / use weapon: All players start without weapon and they can only punch. They can then pick up weapons that give them more range or hit points. (See attack/defense mechanic)
  - Pick up power ups and weapons. 
  - Use power ups (see description of powerups below)
  - Fortify: at any point during the 10 second turn (action view), the player can choose to fortify. Fortify will put this unit in a defensive position and he will remain this way. The unit stays fortified until it gets picked to play again. (See attack/defense mechanic)
* If the 10 seconds run out and the unit is outdoors, then that unit dies instantly.

## ATTACK / DEFENSE MECHANIC
* An attack that hits an enemy unit will remove health from that unit in proportion to the strength of the character multiplied by the damage of the weapon it is using.
* Each attack will take some time to complete, some weapons make this time longer.
* If the attacked unit is fortified, it will take less damage proportionally to it's defense stat.
* If the attacked unit is not fortified, the defence stat is useless.

## POWER UPS
* The player, during the 10 second round, can at any moment use one of the power ups it has picked up before.
* There is a button to cycle through the current power ups. It should be clear on the screen what is the currently selected power up.
* If the player uses the power up it gets spent.

### Adrenaline
The player gets a 10 second 50% boost in speed.

### Rage 
The player gets a 5 second 10% boost in strength

### Time machine
The player can freeze the 10 second counter for 3 seconds

## WEAPONS
